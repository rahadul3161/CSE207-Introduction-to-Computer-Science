Problem-1. Write an if/then/else statement that sets the variable y to the value 1 if x ≥ 0. If x < 0, then the statement should set y to the value 2. (Assume x
already has a value.)


Problem-2. Write an algorithm that gets as input three data values x, y, and z and
outputs the average of these values if the value of x is positive. If the value
of x is either 0 or negative, your algorithm should not compute the average
but should print the error message ‘Bad Data’ instead.


Problem-3. Write an algorithm that gets as input your current credit card balance, the total dollar amount of new purchases, and the total dollar amount of all payments. The algorithm computes the new balance, which this time includes an 8% interest charge on any unpaid balance below $100, 12% interest on any unpaid balance between $100 and $500, inclusive, and 16% on any unpaid balance above $500.
       

Problem-4. Write an algorithm that inputs the length and width, in feet, of a rectangular carpet and the price of the carpet in dollars per square yard. It then determines if you can afford to purchase this carpet, given that your total budget for carpeting is $500.


Problem-5. Add the following feature to the algorithm created in the Practice Problem-5: If the cost of the carpet is less than or equal to $250, output a message that this is a particularly good deal.
